1) what is cloud computing?
practice of using a netwrok of remote servers hosted on the internet to store,manage, and process data rather than a local server or a personal computer.

cloud hosting - multiple physical machines that acts as one system. The system is abstracted into ultiple cloud services.

4 types-
compute
storage
networking
databases

2) wt is microsoft and azure?
microsoft calls their cloud provider service as microsoft azure.

azure - Cloud service provider (CSP)

3) types of cloud computing
Saas (software as a service) eg. gmail
Paas (Platform as a Service) eg. heroku
Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service) eg. microsoft azure, oracle cloud, aws.

4) Cloud deployment model
Public cloud (cloud-native)
Private cloud (on-premise) verything built in companys datacentre
HYbrid (both on-premise and CSP)

Cross-cloud (using multiple CSP) 

5)We can save 75% by using azure intead on on-premise.

6) Cloud architecture terminologies

1.Availability - ability to ensure a service remians available Highly Available(HA), ensuring there is no single point of failure.

2.Scalability -  ability to grow rapidly 
vertical Scaling, HIgh scalability (increase your capacity based on inc demand of traffic)

3.Elasticity - ability to shrink and grow to meet the demand. (ability of inc or dec your capacity based on current demand of traffic )

4.Fault Tolerance - ability to prevent a failure

5. Disaster Recovery -  ability to recover from a failure, Highly Durable(DR)

evolution of computing
dedicated ->virtual machines -> containers ->functions

7) global infrastructure - paired regions

->each region is paired with another region 300 miles away.
->one region is updated at a time to ensure no outages.

Availability Zone(AZ) - a physical location made up of one or more datacenter.
 datacenter -  secured building that contains hundreds of thousands of computers.

8) fault and update domain

9) storage service
Aure blob storage
azure disk storage(ssd /hdd)
azure file storage
azure queue storage
azure table storage

10) db services
azure cosmos db
azure sql db
azure db for mysql/psql/mariaDB
azure db migration service

11)azure integration services
azure api apps
azure service bus
azure logic apps
azure api management

12)developer and mobile terminologies
real time messaging
azure app service(deploying web apps)
visual studio (code editor)

13)azure devops service
azure boards(like github)
azure repos
azure pipelines
etc 

14) azure quickstart template

15)azure virtual network and subnets
virtual network (vNet) is a logically isolated section of the azure network where you can launch your azure resources. you can choose a range of IPs using CIDR range

16) cloud native networking services
azure dns
azure vNet
azure application gateway

17) enterprise /hybrid netwroking services

azure express route (connection between on-premise to azure cloud)
virtual wAN
azure connection (VPN connecton)
Virtual netwrok gateway

18) azure traffic manager

19)AZURE dns(you can create DNS zones and manage your DNS records)

19) azure load balancer
(evenly distributes incoming network traffic across a group of backend resources)

20) scale sets (group together identical virtual machines)

21)Iot services
internet of things
- a network of internet connected objects (usually hardware) able to collect and exchange data.
-smart watches
-smart fridges
-drones
-security cameras

Iot central (connects Iot device to the cloud)
Iot hub
Iot edge

22)big data and analytics services
azure synapse analytics( sql data ware house)
HDinsight (open source analytics software)->hadoop,spark
azure databricks

23)AI/ML services

AI - machines that performs human behaviours
ML - MACHINE GETS BETTER AT A TASK WITHOUT EXPlict programming
DL -  machines that hae an artificial neural netwrok inspired by the humna brain to solve complex problems

azure machine learning service

24)ai services

25)serverless services

26)azure portal - web based unifies console that provides alternative to command line tools.

27) azure poweshell
install azure in windows powershell

azure cloud shell

azure CLI(command line interface)
eg :  az create ,update.delete. view etc

28) creating azure functions
29) azure security (CJIS/CSA/GDPR/etc)

30) azure active directory(cloud based identity and acces management service)

31) multi-factor authentication (MFA)
-> after you fill in the username/email and password, you have to use a second device such as phone to confirm that its you logging in.

32) azure security center

33)key vault (helps you safeguard cryptographic keys and ther screts using cloud apps and services)

34)azure DDos protection

35)azure firewall

36) azure information protection (protects sensitive information such as emails documents, restricted access etc)

37) application gateway
web-traffic load balancer (application firewall can be attached for additional protection)

28)advanced threat protection

29) microsoft security development cycle(SDL)
INDUSTRY-LEADING SOFTWARE SECURITY ASSURANCE process

30) AZURE POLICIES

31) role based access controls
role definations is a collection of permissions that can be performed such as read,write,delete, etc

32)lock resources (you can lock a subscription to prevent other users from accidently deleteing or modifyimg critical resources)

33)management groups

35) service credits (compensation for under-performing) azure product or service)

36) azure marketplace - wordpress etc
